        The series follows the exploits of <em> "The Gang" </em>, a group of narcissistic, sociopathic friends who 
        run the Irish dive bar <em> Paddy's Pub </em> in <em> South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania </em>, but spend most 
        of their free time drinking, scheming, arguing amongst themselves, and plotting elaborate cons against others 
        (and at times each other) for personal benefit, financial gain, revenge, or simply out of boredom, while 
        belittling, berating, and manipulating each other in the process at seemingly any opportunity.

        The series follows the exploits of <em> "The Gang" </em>, a group of narcissistic, sociopathic friends who 
        run the Irish dive bar <em> Paddy's Pub </em> in <em> South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania </em>, but spend most 
        of their free time drinking, scheming, arguing amongst themselves, and plotting elaborate cons against others 
        (and at times each other) for personal benefit, financial gain, revenge, or simply out of boredom, while 
        belittling, berating, and manipulating each other in the process at seemingly any opportunity.

    <h3> Critical reviews and commentary </h3>

    <p style="max-width: 700px;">
        It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia has received critical acclaim for its humor and the 
        performances of the cast. Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker praised the show, calling it 
        "not merely the best sitcom on television but one of the most arresting and ambitious 
        current TV series, period."[49] Gillian Flynn of Entertainment Weekly reviewed the first 
        season negatively, commenting, "[I]t is smug enough to think it's breaking ground, but 
        not smart enough to know it isn't."[50] Brian Lowry of Variety gave the first season a 
        positive review, saying it was "invariably clever and occasionally a laugh-out-loud riot, 
        all while lampooning taboo topics."[51] However, later seasons of the show have received 
        favorable ratings on review aggregator Metacritic, receiving 70/100, 78/100 and 85/100 for 
        seasons 4, 5 and 6 respectively.[52] The show has become a cult hit with viewers and is 
        often compared in style to Seinfeldâ€”particularly due to the self-centered nature of its
         main characters. The Philadelphia Inquirer reviewer Jonathan Storm wrote, "It's like 
         Seinfeld on crack," a quote that became widely used to describe the series,[53] to the 
         point that FX attached the tagline, "It's Seinfeld on crack."[54]
         <br>
         
         In 2014, Entertainment Weekly listed the show at number 7 in the "26 Best Cult TV Shows 
         Ever," with the comment that "it's a great underdog story ... If it sounds too dark for you, 
         consider that there's an episode about making mittens for kittens, and it's adorable."[55] 
         In 2016, a New York Times study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook likes found that 
         Sunny was "more popular in college towns (and most popular in Philadelphia)."[56]
         <br>
         
         In 2015, Rolling Stone rated the top 20 greatest and funniest It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia 
         episodes, stating "for 10 seasons, the series had mined comic gold from the execrable behavior 
         of the owners of Paddy's Pub." They claimed the two-part season 4 episode, "Mac and Charlie 
         Die" is the sitcom's greatest episode yet.[57] In 2019, the BBC called the show "the best US 
         sitcom." They praised the show's unique outlook and ability to range from nihilistic humor to 
         genuine heartfelt moments.
         <br>
         
         According to Matt Fowler of IGN, the series "broke new ground" due to its sociopathic depiction 
         of "The Gang". It was also ranked 63rd in IGN's list of the top 100 TV shows of all-time.

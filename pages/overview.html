    <br>

    <p> It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is an American comedy television series 
        created by Rob McElhenney, and developed by McElhenney and Glenn Howerton, 
        who also serve as writers and executive producers with Charlie Day. 
        The series premiered on August 4, 2005, on FX, and moved to its sister 
        network FXX beginning with its ninth season. 
        The series follows "The Gang", a group of five narcissistic underachievers: 
        twins Dennis (Howerton) and Deandra "Sweet Dee" Reynolds (Kaitlin Olson), 
        their friends Charlie Kelly (Day) and Ronald "Mac" McDonald (McElhenney), 
        and their legal father Frank Reynolds (Danny DeVito), who run Paddy's Pub, 
        a run-down bar in South Philadelphia.

        On December 10, 2020, the series was renewed through an eighteenth season, 
        which would make it the longest-running live-action comedy series in American 
        television history.[1] The fifteenth season, which also saw the series break 
        The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet's record for longest running live-action 
        sitcom in U.S. history, premiered on December 1, 2021.[2][3] As of December 22, 
        2021, 162 episodes of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia have aired, concluding 
        the fifteenth season.

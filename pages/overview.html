    <h3> Overview </h3>

    <p> It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is an American comedy television series 
        created by Rob McElhenney, and developed by McElhenney and Glenn Howerton, 
        who also serve as writers and executive producers with Charlie Day. 
        The series premiered on August 4, 2005, on FX, and moved to its sister 
        network FXX beginning with its ninth season. 
        The series follows "The Gang", a group of five narcissistic underachievers: 
        twins Dennis (Howerton) and Deandra "Sweet Dee" Reynolds (Kaitlin Olson), 
        their friends Charlie Kelly (Day) and Ronald "Mac" McDonald (McElhenney), 
        and their legal father Frank Reynolds (Danny DeVito), who run Paddy's Pub, 
        a run-down bar in South Philadelphia.

        On December 10, 2020, the series was renewed through an eighteenth season, 
        which would make it the longest-running live-action comedy series in American 
        television history.[1] The fifteenth season, which also saw the series break 
        The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet's record for longest running live-action 
        sitcom in U.S. history, premiered on December 1, 2021.[2][3] As of December 22, 
        2021, 162 episodes of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia have aired, concluding 
        the fifteenth season.

    <h3> Critical reviews and commentary </h3>
    <br>

    It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia has received critical acclaim for its humor and the performances of the cast. Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker praised the show, calling it "not merely the best sitcom on television but one of the most arresting and ambitious current TV series, period."[49] Gillian Flynn of Entertainment Weekly reviewed the first season negatively, commenting, "[I]t is smug enough to think it's breaking ground, but not smart enough to know it isn't."[50] Brian Lowry of Variety gave the first season a positive review, saying it was "invariably clever and occasionally a laugh-out-loud riot, all while lampooning taboo topics."[51] However, later seasons of the show have received favorable ratings on review aggregator Metacritic, receiving 70/100, 78/100 and 85/100 for seasons 4, 5 and 6 respectively.[52] The show has become a cult hit with viewers and is often compared in style to Seinfeldâ€”particularly due to the self-centered nature of its main characters. The Philadelphia Inquirer reviewer Jonathan Storm wrote, "It's like Seinfeld on crack," a quote that became widely used to describe the series,[53] to the point that FX attached the tagline, "It's Seinfeld on crack."[54]

In 2014, Entertainment Weekly listed the show at number 7 in the "26 Best Cult TV Shows Ever," with the comment that "it's a great underdog story ... If it sounds too dark for you, consider that there's an episode about making mittens for kittens, and it's adorable."[55] In 2016, a New York Times study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook likes found that Sunny was "more popular in college towns (and most popular in Philadelphia)."[56]

In 2015, Rolling Stone rated the top 20 greatest and funniest It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia episodes, stating "for 10 seasons, the series had mined comic gold from the execrable behavior of the owners of Paddy's Pub." They claimed the two-part season 4 episode, "Mac and Charlie Die" is the sitcom's greatest episode yet.[57] In 2019, the BBC called the show "the best US sitcom." They praised the show's unique outlook and ability to range from nihilistic humor to genuine heartfelt moments.[10]

According to Matt Fowler of IGN, the series "broke new ground" due to its sociopathic depiction of "The Gang". It was also ranked 63rd in IGN's list of the top 100 TV shows of all-time.
